# huffman
my basic c implementation of Huffman coding

I saw the Tom Scott video on the topic and thought it would be fun to write my own implementation

I will endeavour not to use any recourses other than [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8) and [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/759707/efficient-way-of-storing-huffman-tree) for figuring out how to do the actual architecture of the system

## usage
see the `build.sh` and `test.sh` scripts for how to build and use the program
